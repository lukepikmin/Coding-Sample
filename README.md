# Coding-Sample
Coding sample from ECE 763 in Python (primary language used in Grad school) 
In here I have also included a small portion of the training data since it is usually several thousand faces large. 


MATLAB function from ECE 751 Patern Recognition
The actual function is written at the end of the report. The final code is listed out there instead of a MATLAB file 
because I no longer have access to my MATLAB projects
